# Machine-Learning-Workflow
Jupyter notebook demonstrating a basic machine learning workflow using the Breast Cancer dataset built in to Scikit-learn

The notebook covers the following steps:

1) Loading and Understanding the Data: Loading the Iris dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2) Preprocessing the Data: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3) Training and Evaluating Models: Training multiple machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

The models included are:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks (Multi-layer Perceptron)
- Naive Bayes
